## ⚠️ Unity may take up to an hour to process all .egg files during the initial import, as it needs to cache all model data. Your patience is appreciated! ⚠️

## ✨ What is this?

This toolkit brings **Pirates of the Caribbean Online** into Unity, allowing you to import game worlds, export custom content, build new experiences, and create levels using authentic POTCO assets. This was created using the help of AI to expedite the process. So please excuse if the code is 🔥🗑️ but it works! 😎

The whole point of this is to bring out the creativity within our community, creating custom worlds and being able to share them or even potentially create little mini games using the POTCO assets within Unity. One thing that our community lacks from our sister community Toontown is the amount of user generated content. We need more of that!

## 📖 Basic Usage

### Import a World
1. Open `POTCO → World Data Importer`
2. Click "Select World .py File"
3. Choose your world file and click "Import"
4. Watch as your POTCO world appears in Unity!

### Use the Level Editor
1. Open `POTCO → Level Editor`
2. Browse assets using the thumbnail grid
3. Switch between categorization modes (Folder/ObjectList)
4. Drag assets directly into your scene
5. Assets are automatically categorized and ready for export
6. Select "🎯Surface" for any placed models either from importing or dragging out to contain collisions to be able to easily drag and drop props on top seemlessly will cause the world importer to take longer


### Generate a Cave
1. Open `POTCO → Procedural Cave Generator`  
2. Load the "Padres Del Fuego Theme" preset
3. Set cave length (try 10-15 pieces)
4. Click "Generate Cave" and watch it build!

### Import EGG Files
1. Open `POTCO → EGG Importer Manager`
2. Configure filtering options (skip footprints, LOD settings, etc.)
3. Choose folders to exclude (gui, effects recommended)
4. Use "Import All EGG Files" or selective import
5. View statistics in the Statistics tab

### Export Your Scene
1. Add objects to your scene (use Level Editor for easy placement)
2. Open `POTCO → World Data Exporter`
3. Configure export settings and filters
4. Click "Export World Data" to create a `.py` file

**Important Notes:**
- All props must have a parent object to export properly
- Imported WorldData always spawns at (0,0,0)
- Use "Add ObjectListInfo to Selected Objects" for manual object classification

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- Some manually dragged objects may not receive ObjectListInfo components automatically - use "Add ObjectListInfo to Selected Objects" in the exporter
- Large cave systems may occasionally experience piece overlapping
- Complex EGG files with extensive bone data may require additional processing time
